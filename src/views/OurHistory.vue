        <h1>HERON HAVEN WETLAND-A WORK IN PROGRESS!</h1><br>
        <p>The idea for saving a wetland in now the middle of the city of Omaha at 120th& Old Maple Road, came
        about in 1991 when two neighbors, living near the wetland area made a phone call to the Audubon Society of
        Omaha to see if the Society could help the neighbors save the wetland area from becoming a 168-apartment
        complex. Answering the phone for the Audubon office was lone Werthman, a long time environmentalist, who
        had worked tirelessly for years with the National Audubon Society on projects to stop the building of the Two
        Forks Dam in Colorado, which would have destroyed the viability of the Platte River in Nebraska; to stop the
        building the Norden Dam on the Niobrara River and in getting that river designated as a National Scenic River,
        and in 1991when George H. W. Bush was president, she was then involved with a National Audubon nationwide grassroots project to push Congress to declare "no more net loss of wetlands in America".</p><br>
        <p>Mrs. Werthman, visiting the Omaha site, was intrigued with seeing three Great Blue Herons leisurely
        enjoying the waters and fish in what is now the middle of the city of Omaha, (actually then in Douglas County
        because the area was not yet annexed to the city!) Unofficially she named the site "Heron Haven"! 75
        neighbors going with her to the Planning Board meeting to oppose the developers plan, met with surprise
        comments by the Omaha Planning Board Director when he said, "Omaha has no laws to protect and preserve
        wetlands. Therefore there will be a development at this site whether it will be this developer or someone else!
        We should just go home and live with it!"</p><br>
        <p>Leaving the meeting, Mrs. Werthman was handed a check for $200 from one of the neighbors who said
        "Let's buy the property from the owner", and Mrs. Werthman was asked to start fundraising! Having no idea
        of the purchase price, Mrs. Werthman decided to approach the Papio-Missouri Natural Resource District Board
        of Directors with a plan and to ask for help!</p><br>
        <p>(Nebraska, as you know, is the only state in the United States that has implemented a natural resource
        districts policy which addresses river basin management of ground and surface water, soil, conservation
        of habitat, outdoor recreation and outdoor education.)</p><br>
        <p>After much deliberation, the NRD Board voted to pay half of the owners price-- Werthman to secure the
        balance! The owner was persuaded to sell to the Society and NRD instead of to the developer for the same price
        as the developer was paying, but only ifpayment would be made within a one-month time limit! The Audubon
        Society of Omaha voted to donate $50,000 from one of their bequests and Werthman secured donations from
        the public for the rest of Audubon's half!</p><br>
        <p><strong>This was the first time in the history of Nebraska that a non-profit organization cost-shared the
        purchase of land with a Nebraska governmental agency!</strong></p><br>
        <p>Now having 8 acres ofthe 25- acre wetland in a their possession, in 1994, the group next needed a
        parking lot, an office and an education center in order to conduct any programs or business. Mrs. Werthman
        then approached the owner of the "Country Bar" which was located on the premises to see ifhe would sell his
        building and parking lot to us. He would, for $200,000 but not until 1996 after his liquor license ran out.
        Again Mrs.Werthman, with the assistance of the Papio-Missouri River Board lawyer and a real estate salesman
        put together a deal which the bar owner could not resist! Paying him a lower price, which we figured we could
        afford-- two years in advance-- allowed the owner to put the money into savings to make up the difference. We
        got the use of the parking lot and one "back" room ofthe bar with a private entrance for those two years!
        Again, the building was purchased with a share by the Papio-Missouri River NRD, a grant from the Nebraska
        Environmental Trust Fund, and with public donations solicited by Mrs. Werthman.
        In 1996, after "gutting" the bar, and after much remodeling, the doors of the Heron Haven Outdoor
        Education Center opened to the public. The center, which easily seats 75 persons, is now used by Mrs.
        Werthman and the Heron Haven Board of Directors for nature and environmental educational programs --
        nature movies and slide shows, nature classes for school groups, senior citizens and church groups, boy and girl
        scouts, lunches or catered dinners.</p><br>
        <p>A list of programs on a variety of environmental and nature subjects is enclosed and can be scheduled
        by calling the office - 402 -493-4303. Mrs. Werthman, a former high school teacher & professional
        photographer, has been a public speaker on environmental subjects for many years!
        Each fall the group sponsors an open house & fall festival, bringing in live raptors, wild animals, and a
        camaraderie of various butterflies for demonstrations and shows! A newly organized camera club is in the
        process of photographing and recording the 141 species of birds that have already been found using the area and
        are busy photographing as well the mink, woodchucks, deer, amphibians, butterflies, etc. which use the area.
        Even insects are posing for the camera club members! Over 30 boy scouts have received their Eagle project
        badges at the Haven which has helped in creating trails, fences, plantings, benches, signs, etc.
        A butterfly garden shows off a variety of beautiful flowers all summer long, and a native prairie
        demonstration plot shows off the assorted native grasses that grow throughout much of Nebraska.
        In 2003, the Audubon Society of Omaha opted out of their agreement with the Papio-Missouri River
        NRD, so, Mrs.Werthman secured a 501C3 non-profit permit from the Internal Revenue Service under the
        name of "Friends of Heron Haven" and now holds an option lease agreement for the next 20 years with the
        Papio-Missouri River NRD.</p><br>
        <p>This past summer, the Friends arranged for the clean-up and digging of another section of the wetland
        area for a new "dragonfly pond". The area was a partially sunken "concrete rubble dump site which had been
        most likely used by the" state, county and/or city roads departments"!
        (For the record - for years the whole 25 acres of Heron Haven had been an unofficial dump site in
        Douglas County. Ten loads of ,junk" was hauled out of the site in 1994 with Papio-Missouri trucks when the
        Society held several "cleanup days"! )</p><br>
        <p>When and "if' funds become available, the dragon fly pond site will be fenced with recycled plastic
        fencing to match the recycled plastic fence already around the butterfly garden. "Friends" received the recycled
        plastic butterfly garden fence with a grant from the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) !
        Our enclosed latest newsletter tells of the purchase of three more acres by the Papio-Missouri river NRD
        of the twenty-five acre site and that the Corps of Engineers will be helping this coming Fall to restore more of
        the area!</p><br>
        <p>Saving Heron Haven is a "work in progress"!</p><br>
